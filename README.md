# MACHINE LEARNING

## Overview
The Machine Learning component of this application involves building a classification model using Neural Networks and a content-based news recommendation system utilizing NLP models. We employ BeautifulSoup for scraping news articles. The classification model provides feedback to users based on their test results, while the recommendation system suggests similar news articles based on NLP analysis.
